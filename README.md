# Programming Club IITJ

## Steps to setup locally and run:

-   ### Install [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)

*   Launch `yarn` command in a terminal opened in the project folder.
    > This command will look into the `yarn.lock` file and install all the dependencies listed here. We are employing `yarn` instead of `npm`, kindly refrain from using `npm` since it will generate `package-lock.json` instead of looking for `yarn.lock`

-   ### Clone the repository
    > Download this repository `or`

```
git clone https://github.com/pclubiitj/pclub-next.git
cd pclub-next
```

-   ### Start Development Server

```
yarn run dev
```

-   ### Build Project

```
yarn run build
```

-   ### Serve Build

```
yarn start
```

> Before a commit, run `yarn build && yarn start` for production check and `yarn format` for _prettier_ formatting.
